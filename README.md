# Dice-Rolling-Simulator
In this python project, we are going to build a simple dice roll program using Python.
It is a simple program and you will gain knowledge about unicode strings. Apart from this, we used random module to generate the dice numbers randomly.
We also use tkinter to create a graphical user interface, user just need to click on roll button which will generate a random number between 1 and 6.

Project Prerequisites:
   Dice rolling simulator project requires basic knowledge of python and tkinter.
To install tkinter, please run below command:
           pip install tkinter
 Download Dice Rolling Simulator Python Program:
           Please download the source code of python dice rolling simulator: Dice Rolling Simulator Python Code

Project File Structure:
        First, let’s look into the dice rolling simulator python program overview:
               1.Import the random and tkinter modules.
               2.Create the GUI.
               3.Create the dice roll function and the button.
               4.Call the GUI.
Summary:
      We have successfully created python dice rolling simulator. We have learned the use of the classes: random – to generate random numbers when we roll dice and Tkinter: to create a simple user interface. We also learned the basics of classes. Now you can get back to board games using this dice rolling simulator.
